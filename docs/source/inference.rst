Inference Using Pretrained Embedding
--------------------------------------

Users can use DGL-KE to do inference tasks based on pretained embeddings (We recommand using DGL-KE to generate these embedding). Here we support two kinds of inference tasks:

  * **Predicting entities/relations in a triplet** Given entities and/or relations, predict which entities or relations are likely to connect with the existing entities for given relations. For example, given a head entity and a relation, predict which entities are likely to connect to the head entity via the given relation.
  * **Finding similar embeddings** Given entity/relation embeddings, find the most similar entity/relation embeddings for some pre-defined similarity functions.

The ranking result will be automatically stored in the output file (result.tsv by default) using the tsv format.

Predicting entities/relations in a triplet
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The task of linkage score ranking is given a list of candidate (h, r, t) triplets, predicting which head entities are likely to connect to which tail entities via certain relation. An example return value of top5 linkage score likes this::

  src   relation dst   score (DistMult)
  407   5        8429  3.5953474
  3645  3        7121  3.585188
  93    10       7035  3.4557137
  93    9        7035  3.4197974
  2441  5        4833  3.3639894

DGL-KE provides dglke_predict command to predicting entities/relations in a triplet. Currently, we support six models in inference: TransE_l1, TransE_l2, RESCAL, DistMult, ComplEx, and RotatE.

Four arguments are required to provide basic information for doning the linkage score ranking task:

  * ``--data_path``, The path containing the id mapping files, include both the entity mapping file and the relation mapping file
  * ``--model_path``, The path containing the pretrained model, include the embedding files (.npy) and a config.json containing the configure information of the model.
  * ``--format``, The format of the input data, specified in ``h_r_t``. Ideally, user should provides three files, one for head entities, one for relations and one for tail entities. But we also allow users to use *\** to represent *all* of the entities or relations. For example, ``h_r_*`` requires users to provide files containing head entities and relation entities and use the whole entity set as tail entities; ``*_*_t`` requires users to provide a single file containing tail entities and use the whole entity set as head entities and the whole relation set as relations. The supported formats include ``h_r_t``, ``h_r_*``, ``h_*_t``, ``*_r_t``, ``h_*_*``, ``*_r_*``, ``*_*_t``. By default, the calculation will take an N\_h x N\_r x N\_t manner.
  * ``--data_files`` A list of data file names. This is used to provide necessary files containing the requried data according to the format, e.g., for ``h_r_t``, three files are required as h_data, r_data and t_data, while for ``h_*_t``, two files are required as h_data and t_data.
  * ``--raw_data``, A flag tells whether the data profiled in data_files is in the raw object naming space or in mapped id space. If True, the data is in the original naming space and the inference program will do the id translation according to id mapping files. If False, the data is just intergers and it is assumed that user has already done the id translation.

Task related arguments:

  * ``--exec_mode``, How to calculate scores for triplets and calculate topK. 

    * ``triplet_wise``: head, relation and tail lists have the same length N, and we calculate the similarity triplet by triplet: result = topK([score(h_i, r_i, t_i) for i in N]), the result shape will be (K,).
    * ``all``: three lists of head, relation and tail ids are provided as H, R and T, and we calculate all possible combinations of all triplets (h_i, r_j, t_k): result = topK([[[score(h_i, r_j, t_k) for each h_i in H] for each r_j in R] for each t_k in T]), the result shape will be (K,).
    * ``batch_head``: three lists of head, relation and tail ids are provided as H, R and T, and we calculate topK for each element in head: result = topK([[score(h_i, r_j, t_k) for each r_j in R] for each t_k in T]) for each h_i in H, the result shape will be (sizeof(H), K).
    * ``batch_rel``: three lists of head, relation and tail ids are provided as H, R and T, and we calculate topK for each element in relation: result = topK([[score(h_i, r_j, t_k) for each h_i in H] for each t_k in T]) for each r_j in R, the result shape will be (sizeof(R), K).
    * ``batch_tail``: three lists of head, relation and tail ids are provided as H, R and T, and we calculate topK for each element in tail: result = topK([[score(h_i, r_j, t_k) for each h_i in H] for each r_j in R]) for each t_k in T, the result shape will be (sizeof(T), K).

  * ``--topk``, How many results are returned.
  * ``--score_func``, What kind of score is used in ranking. Currently, we support two functions: ``none`` (score = $x$) and ``logsigmoid`` ($score = log(sigmoid(x))$).
  * ``--gpu``, GPU device to use in inference, by default it uses CPU.

Input/Output related arguments:

  * ``--output``, Where to store the result, by default it is stored in result.tsv
  * ``--entity_mfile``, The entity ID mapping file. If not provided we will use the mapping file in ``--data_path`` according to the config.json under ``--model_path``.
  * ``--rel_mfile``, The relation ID mapping file. If not provided we will use the mapping file in ``--data_path`` according to the config.json under ``--model_path``.

Finding similar embeddings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The task of embedding similarity ranking is given a set of entities or relations, finding the most similar entity/relation embeddings for some pre-defined similarity functions. An example of return value of top5 similar entities likes this::

    entity1  entity2  score
    0        0        0.99999
    0        18470    0.91855
    0        2105     0.89916
    0        13605    0.83187
    0        36762    0.76978

DGL-KE provides dglke_emb_sim command to calculate the embedding similarity ranking between entity pairs or relation pairs. Currently we support five different similarity functions: cosine, l2 distance, l1 distance, dot and extended jaccard.

Four arguments are required to provide basic information for doning the embedding similarity ranking task:

  * ``--emb_file``, The numpy file containing the embeddings.
  * ``--format``, The format of the input data.

    * ``l_r``: two list of objects are provided as left objects and right objects.
    * ``l_*``: one list of objects is provided as left objects list and treat all objects in emb\_file as right objects.
    * ``*_r``: one list of objects is provided as right objects list and treat all objects in emb\_file as left objects.
    * ``*``: treat all objects in the emb_file as both left objects and right objects.

  * ``--data_files`` A list of data file names. This is used to provide necessary files containing the requried data according to the format, e.g., for ``e_e``, two files are required as h_data and t_data, while for ``e_*``, one file is required as t_data, and for ``*`` this argument can be omited.
  * ``--raw_data``, A flag tells whether the data profiled in data_files is in the raw object naming space or in mapped id space. If True, the data is in the original naming space and the inference program will do the id translation according to id mapping files. If False, the data is just intergers and it is assumed that user has already done the id translation.

Task related arguments:

  * ``--exec_mode``, How to calculate scores for element pairs and calculate topK.

    * ``pairwise``: both left and right objects are provided with the same length N, and we will calculate the similarity pair by pair: result = topK([score(l_i, r_i)]) for i in N, the result shape will be (K,).
    * ``all``: both left and right objects are provided as L and R, and we calculate all possible combinations of (l_i, r_j): result = topK([[score(l_i, rj) for l_i in L] for r_j in R]), the result shape will be (K,).
    * ``batch_left``: both left and right objects are provided as L and R,, and we calculate topK for each element in L: result = topK([score(l_i, r_j) for r_j in R]) for l_j in L, the result shape will be (sizeof(L), K).
  * ``--topk``, How many results are returned.
  * ``--sim_func``, What kind of distance function is used in ranking and will be output. It support five functions: 1)cosine: use cosine distance; 2) l2: use l2 distance; 3) l1: use l1 distance; 4) dot: use dot product as distance; 5) ext_jaccard: use extended jaccard as distance.
  * ``--gpu``, GPU device to use in inference, by default it uses CPU.

Input/Output related arguments:

  * ``--output``, Where to store the result, by default it is stored in result.tsv
  * ``--mfile``, The ID mapping file.
