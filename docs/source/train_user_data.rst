Train User-Defined Knowledage Graphs
--------------------------------------

Users can use DGL-KE to train embeddings on their own knowledge graphs. In this case, users need to use ``--data_path`` to specify the path to the knowledge graph dataset, ``--data_files`` to specify the triplets of a knowledge graph as well as node/relation ID mapping, ``--format`` to specify the input format of the knowledge graph.

The input format of users' knowledge graphs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Users need to store all the data associated with a knowledge graph in the same directory. DGL-KE supports two knowledge graph input formats:

``raw_udd_[h|r|t]``: In this format, users only need to provide triplets and the dataloader generates the id mappings for entities and relations in the triplets. The dataloader outputs two files: entities.tsv for entity id mapping and relations.tsv for relation id mapping while loading data. The order of head, relation and tail entities are described in ``[h|r|t]``, for example, raw_udd_trh means the triplets are stored in the order of tail, relation and head. The directory contains three files:


  * *train* stores the triplets in the training set. The format of a triplet, e.g., ``[src_name, rel_name, dst_name]``, should follow the order specified in ``[h|r|t]``
  * *valid* stores the triplets in the validation set. The format of a triplet, e.g., ``[src_name, rel_name, dst_name]``, should follow the order specified in ``[h|r|t]``. This is optional.
  * *test* stores the triplets in the test set. The format of a triplet, e.g., ``[src_name, rel_name, dst_name]``, should follow the order specified in ``[h|r|t]``. This is optional.

``udd_[h|r|t]``: In this format, user should provide the id mapping for entities and relations. The order of head, relation and tail entities are described in ``[h|r|t]``, for example, raw_udd_trh means the triplets are stored in the order of tail, relation and head. The directory should contains five files:


  * *entities* stores the mapping between entity name and entity Id
  * *relations* stores the mapping between relation name relation Id
  * *train* stores the triplets in the training set. The format of a triplet, e.g., ``[src_id, rel_id, dst_id]``, should follow the order specified in ``[h|r|t]``
  * *valid* stores the triplets in the validation set. The format of a triplet, e.g., ``[src_id, rel_id, dst_id]``, should follow the order specified in ``[h|r|t]``
  * *test* stores the triplets in the test set. The format of a triplet, e.g., ``[src_id, rel_id, dst_id]``, should follow the order specified in ``[h|r|t]``
